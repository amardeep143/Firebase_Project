create a web application form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which collects user information and stores it in a Firebase Realtime Database. The form should include input fields for name, email, and message, as well as a submit button. When the user submits the form, the data should be saved in the Firebase Realtime Database. The collected data should be displayed in a table format on the webpage using JavaScript DOM functions, without requiring a page refresh.
